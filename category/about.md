</p>

Greetings! My name is [Ary](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aryulianto/), I come from Indonesia.

I am a [Red Hat Certified Architect (RHCA)](https://www.credly.com/users/aryulianto/badges) and hold three certifications in Kubernetes, namely [CKA, CKS, and CKAD](https://www.credly.com/users/aryulianto/badges). Currently, I work as a Cloud Solutions Architect at enterprise Cloud System Integrator and starting my own business at [IMTEK](https://imtek.id).

In my free time, I like to engage in various outdoor activities such as watching football, swimming, hiking, and enjoying a cup of coffee. Also have keen interest in open infrastructure and cloud-native technologies. 

Thank you for taking the time to visit my blog. If you have any questions, feedback, or just want to say hello, please don't hesitate to reach out to me via [saputro@aryulianto.com](mailto:saputro@aryulianto.com)
