UbuCon Asia 2022 is the first in-person and online (hybrid) event, held in Seoul, South Korea from November 26 to 27 2022.

**Before the conference**

Just like applying for a visa to other countries, I handled my Korean visa myself and found the process to be relatively fast, taking about a week. The requirements were quite clear and I was assisted by [Youngbin Han](https://youngbin.xyz) to obtain a business visa to Korea. You can find the requirements at the following link.

My flight departed from Terminal 3 Soetta Jakarta at 10:30 PM WIB and arrived in Incheon at 7:40 AM KST. The immigration process was also quite smooth with the automatic gate. After leaving the airport, I immediately looked for T-money at a convenience store for transportation purposes during my stay there. My next destination was the Stanford Hotel Seoul, where I used Arex to get to Seoul with a travel time of just over an hour.

Upon arriving at the hotel, I met new friends with [Hrittik Roy](https://twitter.com/hrittikhere) from India and [Khairul Aizat Kamarudzzaman](https://www.facebook.com/myfenris) from Malaysia. On the first day, I went to the venue to check out the location where many local organizers were preparing for the event tomorrow. After that, I bought food for lunch and returned to the hotel to rest.

**Day 1 Conference**

I attended several sessions and was quite impressed with the event organizers who provided Korea-English interpreters, making me comfortable and able to participate in any session in the main hall. I also met [Seongsoo Cho](https://twitter.com/seongsoo_kr) from Openstack Korea User Group, and was very happy to meet and have a great time with him!

After the first day was over, I attended the conference dinner and mingled with speakers and other community folks at a fancy party room in [Hongdae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hongdae_(area))!

**Day 2 Conference**

This was the day when I gave my talk about **Play with MAAS (Metal as a Service) CLI** Since morning, I focused on preparing my slides and a live demo. If you want to see the recording and slides that I used, you can visit the following link: [https://2022.ubucon.asia/sessions/play-with-maas-cli/](https://2022.ubucon.asia/sessions/play-with-maas-cli/)

**Group Tour**

The organizer also provided a one-day tour that included a visit to [Insa-dong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insa-dong), [Gyeongbokgung Palace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gyeongbokgung), [Bukchon Hanok Village](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bukchon_Hanok_Village), and [The Painters](https://english.visitkorea.or.kr/enu/ATR/SI_EN_3_2_3.jsp?cid=691388) to saw painting performance show. Thank you for the lovely experience. I really appreciate all the efforts made by the team to make this event a grand success.

**After the Conference**

After the UbuCon 2022 event was over, I moved to [Myeong-dong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myeong-dong) to extend my stay for a few days and enjoy the beauty of the city by exploring around. Besides that, I also went solo hiking to climb [Bukhansan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bukhansan) or Bukhan Mountain, which I might share in a separate article. I was also invited by my friends [Seongsoo](https://twitter.com/seongsoo_kr) and [Seonjae](https://twitter.com/tjswo98sj06) to go to Seoul Sky to enjoy the night view of Seoul city

South Korea is an amazing country that offers a unique blend of traditional and modern culture. The people are friendly and welcoming, and the food is delicious. 

My experience at [UbuCon 2022](https://2022.ubucon.asia/) and in South Korea was unforgettable, and I promise to come back here soon!

**Kamsahamnida (감사합니다), Thank You!**
