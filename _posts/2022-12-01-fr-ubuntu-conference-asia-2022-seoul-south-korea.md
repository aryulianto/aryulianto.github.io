UbuCon Asia 2022 is the first in-person and online (hybrid) event, held in Nuritkum Square, Seoul, South Korea from November 26 to 27.

**Before the conference**

I applied for my own Korean visa, just like I would for a visa to another country, and I realized that the procedure went pretty fast took about a Week. The requirements were quite clear and I was assisted by [Youngbin Han](https://youngbin.xyz) to apply for a C-3-1 (business) visa to Korea. You can find the requirements at the following [link](https://sites.google.com/view/koreanembassy2/visa-jangka-pendek/kunjungan-singkat-umum).

My flight departed from Terminal 3 Soetta Jakarta at 10:30 PM WIB and arrived in Incheon at 7:40 AM KST. The immigration process was also quite smooth with the automatic gate. After leaving the airport, I immediately looked for T-money at a convenience store for transportation purposes during my stay here. My next destination was the Stanford Hotel Seoul, I used Arex to get there, with a travel time of just over an hour.

Upon arriving at the hotel, I met new friends with [Hrittik Roy](https://twitter.com/hrittikhere) from India and [Khairul Aizat Kamarudzzaman](https://www.facebook.com/myfenris) from Malaysia. On the first day, I went to the venue to check the location where many local organizers were preparing for the event tomorrow. After that, I bought food for lunch and returned to the hotel to rest.

**Day 1 Conference**

I attended several sessions and was quite impressed with the event organizers who provided Korea-English interpreters, making me comfortable and able to participate in any session in the main hall. I also met [Seongsoo Cho](https://twitter.com/seongsoo_kr) from Openstack Korea User Group, and was very happy to meet and have a great time with him!

After the first day was over, I attended the conference dinner and mingled with speakers and other community folks at a fancy party room in [Hongdae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hongdae_(area)) :)

Thank you for the lovely experience. I really appreciate all the efforts made by the team to make this event a grand success.

**After the Conference**

After the UbuCon Asia 2022 event, I moved to [Myeong-dong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myeong-dong) to extend my stay for a few days and enjoy the beauty of the city by exploring around. Besides that, I also went solo hiking to climb [Bukhansan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bukhansan) or Bukhan Mountain, which I might share in a separate article.

South Korea is an amazing country that offers a unique blend of traditional and modern culture. The people are friendly and welcoming, and the food is delicious. 

My experience at [UbuCon Asia 2022](https://2022.ubucon.asia/) and in South Korea was unforgettable, and I promise to come back here soon!
