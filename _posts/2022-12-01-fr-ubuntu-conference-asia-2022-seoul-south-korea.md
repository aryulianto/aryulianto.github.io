UbuCon Asia 2022 is the first in-person and online (hybrid) event, held in Seoul, South Korea from November 26 to 27 2022.
**Before the conference**,
Just like applying for a visa to other countries, I handled my Korean visa myself and found the process to be relatively fast, taking about a week. The requirements were quite clear and I was assisted by Young Bin to obtain a business visa to Korea. You can find the requirements at the following link.

My flight departed from Terminal 3 Soetta Jakarta at 10:30 PM WIB and arrived in Incheon at 7:40 AM KST. The immigration process was also quite easy as I used the automatic gate. After leaving the airport, I immediately looked for T-money at a convenience store for transportation purposes during my stay there. My next destination was the Stanford Hotel Seoul, where I used Arex to get to Seoul with a travel time of just over an hour.

Upon arriving at the hotel, I met new friends with Hrritik from India and Fenris from Malaysia. On the first day, I went to the venue to check out the location where many local organizers were preparing for the event tomorrow. After that, I returned to the hotel to rest.

**Day 1 Conference**
I attended several sessions and was quite impressed with the event organizers who provided Korea-English interpreters, making me comfortable and able to participate in any session in the main hall. I also met Seongsoo Cho from Openstack Korea, and was very happy to meet and talk alot with him!

After the first day was over, I attended the conference dinner and mingled with speakers and other community folks at a fancy party room in Hongdae!
