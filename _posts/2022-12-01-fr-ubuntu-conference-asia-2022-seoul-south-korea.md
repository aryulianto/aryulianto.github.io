**Before Conference**

After an 18-hour flight from Jakarta, [Mr. Edwin](https://twitter.com/medwinz) and I finally arrived at Nuremberg. It is the city of [SUSE&#8217;s](https://www.suse.com/) office. We arrived at Nuremberg Airport around 10.00 AM. At first, I thought the immigration checking process would be quite intimidating. Turned out, I was being too paranoid üòÄ The questions asked were standard one, such as what&#8217;s the occasion coming here, where do you stay and for how long.

Afterward, we bought tickets at a kiosk machine with destination to Lange Zeile, the place where we rent an apartment.

We reached the apartment with no hassle. After some rest, we went directly to the openSUSE Conference 2019 venue at <a href="http://z-bau.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Z-Bau</a>. There weren&#8217;t many people around yet.

But we managed to meet with Katrin Murr and Douglas DeMaio, chit-chat for a while and did some helping around.

Before returning to the apartment, we tried to find the nearest mosque to the venue for our Friday prayer. Fortunately, we found it. It is called the Nuremberg Central Mosque. Felt content, we walked back to the apartment, took some rest and waited for the time for our breakfasting, which was around 09.53 PM.

Did I forget to mention that this event was held on the same month with our holy month [Ramadan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramadan)? Yups, we were fasting and it was my first experience having my fasting for more than 14 hours. üôÇ

**Day1 Conference**

Arrived at the location we immediately queued to re-register and take merchandise. at the registration desk I was offered to take a special edition T-shirt or Bag openSUSE Conference. finally I chose T-shirt.
