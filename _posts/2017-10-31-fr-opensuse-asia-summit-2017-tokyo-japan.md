<a href="https://events.opensuse.org/conference/summitasia17" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">openSUSE.Asia Summit 2017 Tokyo</a>, Japan  
This event at Tokyo is the fourth in openSUSE.Asia Summit.  
I become excited to take part in this event, when I heard that Japan has been chosen as the host. One of the ways to take part is by submitting a paper.

Not long after, I got the news that my paper was accepted. Yeay, finally I can go to Japan. Along with my friends who also got accepted too, we bought and prepared all the things needed.

Three day before the actual main event, with three of my friends from <a href="http://glibogor.or.id" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GNU/Linux Bogor</a>, we left from Jakarta to Tokyo by ANA _(All Nippon Airways)_. The journey to Tokyo took around 7 hours _(3,596 Miles)_

The first day arrived in Tokyo, I was very surprised by the weather. It was around 10¬∞C. Me and my friend <a href="http://blog.kukuh.syafaat.id/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kukuh</a>, only got time to go around Shibuya and see Hachiko statue. After that, we went directly to our place of stay.

The second day, we went out around noon and decided to visit the <a href="http://fujiko-museum.com/english/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fujiko F Fujio</a> Museum. After that, at night we came to the welcome party held by the committee at UEC <a href="http://www.uec.ac.jp/eng/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(University of Electro Communications)</a>.

Since I still got two more days left in Tokyo, me and my friend <a href="http://dhenandi.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dhenandi</a>, moved to hostel near Sens≈ç-ji temple in Asakusa and have planned to visit some places nearby.

The last day in Japan, before going back home, I took the time to go to Odaiba to see Gundam and Liberty statues. They are huge! üòÄ
