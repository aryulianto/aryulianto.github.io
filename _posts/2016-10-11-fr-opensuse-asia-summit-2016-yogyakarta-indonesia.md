**On June 6th, 2016** Indonesia has been chosen as the next place for the openSUSE Asia Summit. The committee opened <a href="https://news.opensuse.org/2016/06/27/opensuse-asia-summit-call-for-papers-is-open/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Call For Paper</a> from June 22th, 2016 until August 3rd, 2016. After reading the announcement I started to write a paper about <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/SaputroAryulianto/clustering-docker-with-docker-swarm-on-opensuse" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Clustering Docker with Docker Swarm on openSUSE</a>

Fortunately, my paper was chosen as one of accepted papers. Hence, I became one of the Speakers for the conference. I felt so excited, to support my presentation I made some experiments on Docker&#8217;s Clustering

After that, I applied for financial support to the openSUSE.  
The committee accepted my travel support proposal, Yeah! _<del datetime="2016-10-11T01:31:30+00:00">but with some minor changes </del>ðŸ˜›_

On the day before the actual main event. I, along with my other 9 friends from <a href="http://glibogor.or.id" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GNU/Linux Bogor</a> , left from Jakarta to Yogyakarta by train (Taksaka Pagi). The journey to Yogyakarta took around 8 hours.

On the next day, there was the pre summit (Day0) where I attended the workshop as a participant with <a href="http://www.winardiaris.xyz/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Aris</a>.
